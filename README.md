Unity Procedural Generation Toolkit
Overview
The Unity Procedural Generation Toolkit is a collection of scripts and utilities designed to aid developers in generating procedural content within Unity projects. Leveraging the power of Unity's Burst compilation and job system, this toolkit provides efficient algorithms for generating various types of noise, meshes, and shapes, making it suitable for real-time applications such as games, simulations, and visualizations.

Features
Noise Generation: Includes implementations of value noise, Perlin noise, and turbulence for generating coherent noise patterns.
Mesh Generation: Provides utilities for procedurally generating meshes, including planes, spheres, and toruses, with customizable parameters.
Shape Generation: Offers interfaces and structs for defining and generating various geometric shapes such as planes, spheres, and toruses.
Parallel Processing: Utilizes Burst-compiled jobs for parallel processing of large datasets, ensuring optimal performance even in complex scenarios.
Customization: Designed to be easily extensible and customizable, allowing developers to integrate their own noise algorithms, mesh generation methods, and shape definitions.
Contents
The Unity Procedural Generation Toolkit consists of the following components:

Noise: Namespace containing noise generation algorithms and utilities.
MeshGeneration: Scripts for procedural mesh generation, including basic shapes like planes, spheres, and toruses.
